### Hello to anyone visiting my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring programmer - dabbling since 2020, serious studying since January 2021!  Rather than take a blunt swiss army knife of programming languages into the market, in 2021, I decided to sharpen one skill to the very best of my ability: C++!  2022 will be another transitional year, but I hope to end with a comprehensive knowledge of all major Data Structures&Algorithms, as well as able to confidently solve most exercises found on LeetCode!   I'm following Moustafa Saad Ibrahim's roadmap to the industry!

2022 Plan:

Jan-mid Feb:  [Consolidate knowledge of most major DS (Arrays, Vectors, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, Tries, Hash Tables)](https://www.udemy.com/course/dscpp-skills/)

Feb-Jun: [Master Algorithms used in C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp/)

Jul-Oct:  [Work on Coding Interview Questions, and problem solving skills](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-coding-interviews/)

Oct-Dec:  Review of all beginner-intermediate topics in C++, deeper dive into OOP - and find and select interesting project to help me break into the industry!

Once I'm through with the three Udemy courses above, I'll be delving further into consolidating my knowledge of the rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS learned so far, as well as working on forging and sharpening my other tools!   I imagine I'll be attempting the Odin Project one day, as well as working through (and building a deep understanding) of all languages covered in Colt Steele's Web Development course.   I'm looking forward to seeing how all this pans out in the future - and looking back on this profile in January 2023!
