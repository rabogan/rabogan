### Hello to anyone visiting my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bobby, a C++ programmer and problem solver!

In 2021, I got used to figuring out the basics of C++.  In 2022, I put a lot of work into developing my knowledge of DSA, and improving my problem solving skills, with a fair degree of success.  In 2023, I put a lot of working into diversifying the skill-set by making really challenging and credible projects (to be released in 2024!)!  I'm comfortable with the Azure Platform, C++, C#, React and SQL - but looking forward to learning more in 2024!

2024 Plans:
1) Receive the AZ-204 Azure Developer Associate Cert (Test On April 19th)
2) Deploy my project via Azure (ACHIEVED!)  Uses an SQL Server and SQL Database, with a Static Web App for the React front and an App Service for the C# backend
3) After the project has gone up, build a solid understanding of the MERN stack, and demonstrate this in further projects
4) While working on the personal projects, I want to successfully interview with a company in the SoCal area.  Ideally, I'll find myself in a corporate culture that encourages continual self-development, and rewards people who are driven and productive!  (I also hope to be continually learning and evolving on-the-job!)

2023:
Oct-Dec: Picked up the AZ-900 Azure Certification.  Now working on the AZ-204 while looking at using Azure to deploy an exciting upcoming .NET/React project!
Jul-Sep: Continued with the C#.NET language, and really dove deeply into React for the front-end of the project (2024 release!)
Apr-Jun: Started work on an upcoming project (2024 release, but it's quite big!).  Learned and became comfortable with C#.NET Core and SQL
Jan-Mar: I completed this Udemy course by Mostafa Saad Ibrahim in this link to finish DSA studies: [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp2/)

2022:
Oct-Dec:  Review of all beginner-intermediate topics in C++, deeper dive into OOP - and find and select interesting project to help me break into the industry!   DEEPER DIVE DONE, but I have selected WebDev-based projects, with an eye on diving deeper into the MERN stack
Jul-Oct:  Worked on Coding Interview Questions, and problem solving skills with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-coding-interviews/)
Feb-Jun: Masteedr Algorithms used in C++ (basic sorting, graphs, binary searches) using this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp/)
Jan-mid Feb:  Consolidated knowledge of most major DS (Arrays, Vectors, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, Tries, Hash Tables) from this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/dscpp-skills/)
