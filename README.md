### Hello to anyone visiting my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on building up my knowledge with C++, and I intend to try and gain a better 'big picture' understanding with that language for the time being.  Having started studying on a few different fronts in September 2020, I'll be spending June-Sept 2021 working almost exclusively on improving my C++ base.

Once I feel I've got a good mastery of the basics, I'll be delving further into consolidating my knowledge of the rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS learned so far, as well as diving deeper into other web development languages, including Javascript.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch!
