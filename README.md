### Hello to anyone visiting my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring programmer - dabbling since 2020, serious studying since January 2021!  Rather than take a blunt swiss army knife of programming languages into the market, in 2021, I decided to sharpen one skill to the very best of my ability: C++!  In 2022, I put a lot of work into developing my DSA and Problem Solving Skills, with success.  In 2023, I will be building up lasting projects, while reviewing acquired skills!  It's all about OUTPUT and PROJECTS this year - I hope to find a job before the summer!

2023 Plan:

General:
1)  I want to build a solid understanding of the MERN stack, and demonstrate this in projects
2)  I want to successfully interview with a company in the SoCal area

Jan-Mar 1:  [I have already achieved a good understanding of basic DS and algorithms.  Completing the Udemy course by Mostafa Saad Ibrahim in this link will finalize my tentative DSA study](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp2/)

Jan-Mar 2:  [Simultaneously, I will be working on this Web Development course by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

ADDITIONALLY:  [Please check out my (currently unreadable) website for the above course](https://rabogan.github.io/ColtSteelePractice/)

Jan-Mar 3:  [As well as that, I'm trying to use Unix/Git to build another project via the Odin Project: I will take the Node path, hopefully in March](https://rabogan.github.io/odin-recipes/)


2022 Plan:

Jan-mid Feb:  [Consolidate knowledge of most major DS (Arrays, Vectors, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, Tries, Hash Tables)](https://www.udemy.com/course/dscpp-skills/)   ACHIEVED!

Feb-Jun: [Master Algorithms used in C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp/)   ACHIEVED!

Jul-Oct:  [Work on Coding Interview Questions, and problem solving skills](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-coding-interviews/)  ACHIEVED!

Oct-Dec:  Review of all beginner-intermediate topics in C++, deeper dive into OOP - and find and select interesting project to help me break into the industry!   DEEPER DIVE DONE, but I have selected WebDev based projects, with an eye on diving deeper into the MERN stack
