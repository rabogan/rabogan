# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Profile Page!

Hi, I'm **Bobby**, a problem solver based in **Southern California**!

In 2021, I got used to figuring out the basics of **C++**.  
In 2022, I put a lot of work into developing my knowledge of **DSA**, and improving my **problem-solving skills**.  
In 2023, I put a lot of work into **diversifying my skill set** by building really challenging and credible projects!  
In 2024, I became comfortable with the **Azure Platform, C++, C#, React, Flask**, and **SQL**.  I deployed one project on Azure, and completed another which I use with my ESL students.
However, with the job market being rather daunting without a CS degree, I pivoted toward finding work in the **IT industry**.

As a result, my studies in software development have taken a backseat since completing **Harvard CS50x** in July 2024.  
My dream job is still very much to work as a **Software Developer**!

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals for 2025:**  
Complete my studies at **Calbright College**, earn the **Network+ and Security+ certifications**, begin working toward **CySA+**, and land a **full-time position in tech**.
