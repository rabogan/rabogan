### Welcome to my profile page! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Bobby, a problem solver based in Southern California!

- In 2021, I got used to figuring out the basics of C++. In 2022, I put a lot of work into developing my knowledge of DSA, and improving my problem solving skills, with a fair degree of success. In 2023, I put a lot of work into diversifying the skill-set by making really challenging and credible projects! In 2024, I became comfortable with the Azure Platform, C++, C#, React, Flask and SQL. However, with the job market rather daunting without a CS degree, I pivoted towards finding work in the IT industry. As a result, my studies in software development have taken a backseat since completing the Harvard CS50x in July 2024. My dream job is still very much to find work as a software developer! 2025 will see me complete studies with my part-time employer (Calbright College), and I'm aiming to collect the Network+ and Security+ certifications â€“ as well as starting work towards the CySA+! However, my chief goal will be to find a full-time position in the tech industry.
